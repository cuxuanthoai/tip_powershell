# Step 1: Open terminal and edit the shell configuration file
# For bash (older macOS versions), use:

nano ~/.bash_profile

# For zsh (newer macOS versions), use:
nano ~/.zshrc

# Step 2: Add this line to the end of the file (replace /path/to/scripts with your actual directory)
export PATH="/path/to/scripts:$PATH"

# Example:
# export PATH="~/java_scripts:$PATH"

# Step 3: Save the file and exit nano (Ctrl + X, then Y to confirm)

# Step 4: Reload the profile to apply the changes:
source ~/.bash_profile  # or source ~/.zshrc
